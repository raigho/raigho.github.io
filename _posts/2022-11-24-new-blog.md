Hello there! This is a new blog I threw together with GitHub Pages and Jekyll. This was done on a twitch live stream over at https://twitch.tv/raighohusky !

The idea behind starting a new blog is to journal and write notes or stories on what I've been working and documenting the journey and discoveries as I go. I want to share what I do and what I find interesting with the world because even if one person is inspired or learns something new then it was worth doing.

Most of the content here will be rough off the top of my head and honest technical thoughts with the odd random update post. Feel free to bookmark or subscribe to the XML feed which is in the bottom left corner.

Hope to start posting some exciting content soon, see you then!
